# 1896-2024 Summer Olympic Medals
 Olympic  Medals Over the years

## Overview

This project explores the historical data of Olympic medals from 1896 to 2024 to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to national and continental performance. By analyzing this extensive dataset, the goal was to understand the factors influencing medal outcomes, such as age, medal types, and host country advantages. The project also seeks to identify trends in medal efficiency and the impact of hosting the Olympics on a country’s performance. The insights gained can offer valuable perspectives on how different nations and continents have evolved in their Olympic success over time.

# *Methods*

### *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:* The dataset was prepared by handling missing values and ensuring consistency in the data, particularly focusing on standardizing country names and codes.

### *Feature Engineering:* Additional features were created to enhance the analysis:

*Medal Efficiency:* A metric to evaluate the efficiency of countries in winning medals relative to their participation.

*Host Advantage:* A measure to analyze the impact of hosting the Olympics on medal counts.

*Medal Trend:* The percentage change in total medals won by each country across different Olympic Games.

### *Visualizations:* Various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and line plots, were used to illustrate key findings:

- Medal trends of top-performing countries.
- Comparison of continental performance across different Olympics.
- Age distribution and its significance in medal-winning performances.


## *Visualizations*

### *Hypothesis Testing:* Several hypotheses were tested to validate assumptions:

*Medal Efficiency and Continent Performance:* Analyzing whether certain continents consistently outperform others.

*Host Advantage Hypothesis:* Testing if hosting the Olympics significantly impacts a country’s total medal count.

*Effect of Medal Type on Medal Efficiency:* Investigating if the type of medal won influences a country’s efficiency.

*Medal efficiency across different countries:* Looking for correlation between Medal efficiency and countries.

*Medal efficiency effects on medal trends:* Looking at medal efficiency correlation with medal trends.

*Host advantage effect on most common medal:* Looking for correlation between the host advantage and most common medal won when a country is hosting the Olympics.
